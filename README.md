# Viewport Reticle Sample Kit Extension
![Camera Reticle Preview](exts/omni.sample.reticle/data/preview.png)

The Camera Reticle extension adds a new menu button to all viewports. From this menu, users can enable and configure:
1. Composition Guidelines
2. Safe Area Guidelines
3. Letterbox

I created this to learn and test the Kit SDK. To have a clear design target, I designed the UI as a look-alike of 
the similar Unreal Engine Cinematic Viewport control. Even though this was just a test, feel free to use this
extension to help compose your shots or as an example to learn from.
